# Spam-Filtering-System
Using Machine Learning and DataScience, I used a online database of messages classified as Spam or Ham to create a model to predict if a message is Spam or Ham.
There is multiple machine learning techniques used so far;
<ul>
<li>Naive Bayes</li>
<li> KKN - nearest neighbour </li
</ul>
